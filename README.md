## [Calculation-of-roofing-materials](https://github.com/Andruxa7/Calculation-of-roofing-materials)
iOS application for calculating roofing materials and components

This application will help to make a quick calculation of roofing materials and components. It is so simple and does not require special skills in the field of roofing that this application can be easily used by both the builder and the average user. All you need to do is choose the shape of the roof that interests you and fill in the data in the cells. After all the data has been entered, the "Calculate" button will appear. After clicking on this button, there will be a transition to the next screen, where information about the parameters entered by the user and the result of the calculation with a list of required materials will be displayed.
After that, you can either return to the first screen by pressing the Home button and start a new calculation, or share the result of the calculation with someone, for example, by sending it by mail to a roofing company, or simply save it on your phone.
