## [Rick and Morty App](https://github.com/Andruxa7/RickAndMortyApp)
iOS App to list Rick and Morty characters

Rick and Morty app uses Api from them, recollect all characters and they details.
Also in this application there is the ability to sort characters using the SearchBar.
But for a more accurate search for characters, this application implements a method based on the UIMenu. All you need to do is just click the Sort button located in the upper right corner of the screen and select the desired sorting option from the menu that appears.
Also in this application there is an opportunity to highlight your favorite characters with a mark in the form of a heart. How to do it? Very simple, for this you need to click on the character that interests you and go to the detailed screen and click on the button in the form of a heart located in the upper right corner of the screen. When pressed, the button will change its color from gray to red, which means that this character is marked as a favorite.

## [Calculation-of-roofing-materials](https://github.com/Andruxa7/Calculation-of-roofing-materials)
iOS application for calculating roofing materials and components

This application will help to make a quick calculation of roofing materials and components. It is so simple and does not require special skills in the field of roofing that this application can be easily used by both the builder and the average user. All you need to do is choose the shape of the roof that interests you and fill in the data in the cells. After all the data has been entered, the "Calculate" button will appear. After clicking on this button, there will be a transition to the next screen, where information about the parameters entered by the user and the result of the calculation with a list of required materials will be displayed.
After that, you can either return to the first screen by pressing the Home button and start a new calculation, or share the result of the calculation with someone, for example, by sending it by mail to a roofing company, or simply save it on your phone.
